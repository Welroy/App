            <p>Britain had been the worldwide trend-setter in tank development from 1915, but had lost its leadership
                position as the Second World War approached. Hampered by restricted expenditure in the years leading
                up the war and still organised for operations in Imperial defence as an expeditionary force, the British
                Army entered the war unprepared for the very sort of combat its influential theorists such as J.F.C.
                Fuller and B. H. Liddell Hart had advocated.[16]
                The British Army had developed two types of tanks - "Infantry Tanks" which were heavily armoured with
                good all terrain performance but were slow. This lack of speed was not considered a flaw as they were
                designed to support infantry assaults on enemy strong points or urban warfare where the ability to
                outpace a man on foot was deemed unnecessary. The other type were "Cruiser Tanks" which were intended
                for independent maneuvering, rapid breakouts and flanking attacks. Early Cruiser tanks gained
                performance at a cost in the armour they could carry. Reliability was an important issue especially in
                the harsh conditions of North Africa and the mountainous terrain of Southern Europe, where the A10 and
                A13 in particular were plagued by broken tracks and overheating engines.</p>
