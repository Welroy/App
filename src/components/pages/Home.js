The combat system evolved much from its infancy witnessed during World War 1 (1914-1918) and grew to become a focal point of the many offensives had in the Second Grand War - spanning from Europe to the Pacific and all places in between. The conflict delivered into armored warfare history such classics as the German 'Panther' and 'Tiger' types, the Soviet T-34, the British 'Churchill' and the American 'Sherman'. Before the end, the Allies would be crowned the victors thanks largely to numerical superiority, setting the groundwork for a whole new generation of tanks to come in the Cold War years (1947-1991).</p>
