                <p>The Maus was a super-heavy tank, heavier than the LÃ¶we. It translates to "Mouse" in German. Only 2 prototypes were built, one of which was incomplete, and only one had the turret mounted, which was later destroyed. The other chassis was captured by the Soviets, who later mounted the turret from the other, completed Maus, which had its chassis destroyed at the end of the war by demolition charges.</p>
