My App is a blog about Tanks which were used in World War 2
It has a header, a nav bar and a footer layout. In order to use and successfully implement the App i had to install a few modules like 
react-router which was used to link the js files to the main page
Finally to run the project just use "npm start" on the terminal.(P.S make sure you are in the App directory)
Also  the following video helped a lot for connecting the components to main app file https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iAG6h9ff5s
